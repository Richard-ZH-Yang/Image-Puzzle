# Image-Puzzle
## About
<p>
Image-Puzzle can split an image into blocks of smaller pieces of that image. By applying a doubly-linked list, it can randomly scramble the image given the number of blocks, as well as restore these blocks into the original image by comparing the pixel similarities on the edge of the smaller images
 </p>


## Usage
```
make
./main
```

Able to see the output of the image under _images_ folder depends on the code in the main function
